## Todos

### What are done?

1. Cars api
2. JWT Authentication (ROLE BASED)

### What to do next?

1. User need to logout
2. Session management
3. Refresh token functionality

   ### Issues:

   1. As JWT is STATELESS, Session management is not possible.
   2. JWT token itself holds the authentication state, so there isn't a traditional server-side session to invalidate upon logout.
